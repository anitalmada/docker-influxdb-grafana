# Grafana test dashboards

This are the first Grafana dashboards I designed, for memory, CPU usage and disk free space.

First I forked this repo: [https://github.com/nicolargo/docker-influxdb-grafana](https://github.com/nicolargo/docker-influxdb-grafana)

Then made a few panels and set some alerts.

You can import this dashboard copying the json file from this repo or downloading and importing the file from your Grafana.
